OpenMotif
===

This is a copy of the Open Motif repository at
https://git.code.sf.net/p/motif/code .

That repo is maintained by ICS MotifZone: https://motif.ics.com/

This repo is an attempt to fix some things since it looks like ICS
MotifZone isn't really maintaining this any more.

The initial import is located in the motifzone branch.  Any further
updates from them will be located there.

Development in this repo will be done on the 'main' branch.

The idea here is to fix up things to make it easier to build on more
modern systems and allow greater participation of the development
community.
